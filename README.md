# NodeJSHomeAutomationIdea
Yet another 2 AM idea to make something. The goal is a home automation server with a JSON API. **I will write a better README soon. Check out [[# Documentation]](https://github.com/egold555/NodeJSHomeAutomationIdea/tree/master/%23%20Documentation) for some documentation for now :)
